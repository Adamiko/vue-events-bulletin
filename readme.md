## Vue Events Bulletin Board

This is the code for the Vue.js [tutorial on Scotch.io](https://scotch.io). In the tutorial we build a events bulletin board application and cover the basics of [Vue](http://vuejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `node server.js`.
3. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## What's New in This Forked Branch

This forked branch is much advancedly modified by Jason Lam. The shining points are below:

1. Use Node.js & Express for backend server and router.
2. RESTful requests towards the server to simulate CRUD on events, instead of local hardcoded ones.
3. Translated into Traditional Chinese, if that is worth mentioning. Meh.
